# SQL Practice Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of SQL exercises and resources intended for both beginners and intermediates who want to master SQL through practical, hands-on examples. The content is organized into daily practice files and an interactive Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Structure

- **Day1.sql** to **Day6.sql**: Each SQL script corresponds to one day of focused practice. These files cover a progressive range of SQL conceptsâ€”from basic SELECT queries and filtering, to more advanced topics like JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, and set operations.
- **SQL.ipynb**: An interactive Jupyter Notebook that allows you to run SQL code, view results, and follow along with explanations. Ideal for experimenting and deepening your understanding.
- **LICENSE**: The repository uses the MIT License, making it open for learning and reuse.

## Key Features

- **Stepwise Learning**: Each day builds on concepts from the previous day, ensuring steady progress.
- **Practical Examples**: All scripts use real-world inspired problems to make learning relevant.
- **Interactive Notebook**: The included notebook is perfect for those who prefer a hands-on, interactive approach to learning SQL.
